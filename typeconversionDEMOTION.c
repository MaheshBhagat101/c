//here the as we have already mentioned above that it is integer value bt we put a decimal
// value so the compiler will only take the digit before the decimal point and ignore the rest 
// and the output shown will be 3 as above 
//so, it is called demotion bcz the higher value(3.5) is reduced to lower value(3)
